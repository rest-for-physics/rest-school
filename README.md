### REST-for-Physics school repository

This repository contains exercises and data necessary to follow the sessions at the REST-for-Physics school program. The school schedule is divided in days and days are divided in sessions.

The first school event (containning all the materials) is hosted at the following [Indico site](https://indico.capa.unizar.es/event/26/).

Directory contents:

- **data:** Pre-generated datasets that will be used during the course.
- **dayX:** A directory that contains the exercises for a particular school day X.

#### Issues with exercises

The README.md provided inside the different sessions inside this repository should be enough to follow all the activities proposed in the school in offline mode. 

Please, in case of issues following any of the exercises, create an issue at this repository, tagging some of the rest-school contributors.
